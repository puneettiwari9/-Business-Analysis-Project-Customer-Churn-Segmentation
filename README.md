# 📊 Business Analysis Project – Customer Churn & Segmentation

This repository contains the deliverables for my **Business Analysis Internship Project** with **SaiKet Systems**.  
The project focuses on analyzing **customer churn** in a telecommunications company and developing visualizations & insights to identify at-risk customers.

---

## 🏗 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Analyze customer churn behavior, clean and prepare data, perform exploratory analysis, and create visualizations for customer segmentation.  
- **Dataset:** `Telco_Customer_Churn_Cleaned_dataset.CSV`  
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### **Task 1 – Understand the Dataset**
- Loaded dataset with Pandas  
- Displayed first 10 rows  
- Checked data types of each column  
- Verified missing values  
- **Output:** Dataset summary & preview  

---

### **Task 2 – Data Cleaning**
- Handled missing values (imputation/drop)  
- Removed duplicates  
- Standardized column names (lowercase, underscores)  
- **Output:** Clean, analysis-ready dataset  

---

### **Task 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Generated summary statistics (mean, median, mode)  
- Created histograms & boxplots  
- Analyzed churn proportions (churn vs. non-churn)  
- **Output:** Distribution plots & churn visualization  

---

### **Task 4 – Customer Segmentation Visualization**
- Created tenure groups: `0–12 months`, `13–36 months`, `37+ months`  
- Donut chart → distribution across tenure groups  
- Clustered bar chart → average monthly charges across groups  
- Added annotations to highlight trends  
  - Newer customers tend to pay higher charges  
  - Long-term customers often have stable charges  
- **Output:** Interactive visualizations
